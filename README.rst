Terminal Coin Ticker
####################

Not much to this at the moment. Just a silly attempt at a basic coin ticker for
modern terminal emulators. Pass ``--help`` for usage. Python 3.6+ and (likely)
Linux only, for now.

Running in alacritty_ (Gnome/Fedora 27)

- The plan is to have color schemes adopt exchange branding on `24-bit terms`_
- Additional asciicasts showing current/future options coming soon:

  - (|one|_) |two|_
  - (|three|_) |four|_

Installation
    An executable wrapper called ``tc-ticker`` is available when installed via
    pip.  Otherwise, ``/terminal_coin_ticker/ticker.py`` works as a file arg,
    so long as Python can summon websockets_ or aiohttp_.

.. _aiohttp: https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io
.. _websockets: https://websockets.readthedocs.io


Notes
    ``HAS_24`` can be used instead of ``COLORTERM`` in environments where the
    latter is forbidden. The board's width is determined by the price with the
    most decimal places (that with the smallest "tick size"). Prices exceeding
    $10 in the USD(T) market are rounded to cents.


TODO
    #. Migrate this list to one or multiple issues threads
    #. Support 3.4+. Seems the only roadblocks are ``async``/``await`` and
       ``__aiter__``
    #. Cache session args (pairs) for use easy reuse
    #. If sort-by-volume is on, re-order while running (might be disorienting,
       so maybe this should be optional)
    #. Convert env-var options to proper ``argparse``/``getopt`` options
    #. Use proper logging
    #. Fill the entire width of the terminal window with the relevant background
       color and distribute the remaining space evenly

Motivation
    Initially a favor for a friend, now more or less a renewed effort to make
    sense of this asyncio business.
